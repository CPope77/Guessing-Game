# Guessing-Game
Guessing Game is a game I made in Python. It randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number in order to win the game. The program uses the randint() function in Python to generate the number. It tests to see if the guessed number is equivalent to the secret number, and gives congratulatory messages if the player wins the game.
